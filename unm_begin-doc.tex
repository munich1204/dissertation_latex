\begin{dedication}
   To my parents, Tami and Randy, for their support and encouragement. Aren't you glad I'm not an ornithologist? \\[3ex]

   I would like to thank my friend and advisor, Mark Stone, for his trust and encouragement during my PhD program. I would not have moved to New Mexico without knowing you would be an excellent mentor and beer-drinking companion.

   \noindent{I  am also gracious for the support and free whitewater boating trips provided by the great New Mexico water resources community, including Mindy Harm Benson, Mike Harvey, Reed Benson, Dagmar Llewellyn, Steve Harris, and others.}

   \noindent{Finally, I still can't believe the encouragement given by my wife, Leslie, even while we lived 1,000 miles apart for two years. Thank you, Sweetie.\\ \emph{``Home is wherever I'm with you.''}}

\begin{abstract}
   The theory of relativity is a real ``toughie'' to prove, but with the
   help of my family and my great grandpa Al, this paper presents the
   proof in its entirety.  Most of the math is correct, and the
   part about ``warp speed'' and ``parallel universe'' sounds very high-tech.
