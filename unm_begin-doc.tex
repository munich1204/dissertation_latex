   I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Martin Sheen, for his support
   and some great action movies.  I would also like to thank my dog, Spot,
   who only ate my homework two or three times.  I have several other people
   I would like to thank, as well.\footnote{To my brother and sister, who
   are really cool.}

\begin{abstract}
   The theory of relativity is a real ``toughie'' to prove, but with the
   help of my family and my great grandpa Al, this paper presents the
   proof in its entirety.  Most of the math is correct, and the
   part about ``warp speed'' and ``parallel universe'' sounds very high-tech.

\setlength{\parskip}{0cm plus2mm minus2mm} % Set the spacing between paragraphs
\setlength{\parindent}{1cm} % Remove all paragraph indentation

\linespread{1.3} % A line spread factor of 1.3 produces 1.5 lines spacing (not very intuitive, I know)

\raggedbottom % Allow page bottoms to be empty so the paragraphs aren't stretched across the page at the end of sections
