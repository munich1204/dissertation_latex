\setlength{\parskip}{0cm plus2mm minus2mm} % Set the spacing between paragraphs
\setlength{\parindent}{1cm} % Remove all paragraph indentation

\linespread{1.3} % A line spread factor of 1.3 produces 1.5 lines spacing (not very intuitive, I know)

\raggedbottom % Allow page bottoms to be empty so the paragraphs aren't stretched across the page at the end of sections
